# Completed TODOs Archive

This directory contains completed TODO documents for historical reference.

## Archival Strategy

**When a TODO is complete:**
1. Move from project root to `/completed/`
2. Keep original filename for traceability
3. Reference in session notes/commits

**Why Archive Instead of Delete:**
- Provides project history
- Documents decision-making process
- Enables pattern recognition across TODOs
- Useful for session notes and progress tracking
- Shows evolution of the project

## Completed TODOs

- `TODO_002_Docker_Setup.md` - Docker containerization (completed Dec 19, 2025)

**Current TODO:** Check project root for active TODO_xxx files
